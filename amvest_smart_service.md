## Improving livability planning process

**Executive Summary:**
This project aimed to help Amvest introduce and implement a data-driven solution in amenities planning. By conducting interviews with an Amvest developer and mapping the developerâ€™s processes, it could be concluded that *There is almost no data available on the composition and number of commercial buildings and how these buildings affect livability*. Therefore, the main question of this project could be phrased as: *"How might we enable Amvest to make data-driven decisions on commercial space development that improve livability?"*. 
The end product is the analytical dashboard that shows the impact on livability for all types and numbers of commercial spaces.

### 1. Business Problem:
In the real estate industry context, factors such as access to amenities, healthcare, and education significantly affect the perceived value of properties. Therefore, it is essential for Amvest, a real estate company, to consider amenities that fulfill neighborhood demands and enhance livability. However, the developing stakeholders do not have sufficient quatatative data about amenities amount, hence, it takes much time for commercial space planning.

### 2. Methodology
1. Data were collected from ten cities of Amvest's projects, focusing on amenities such as supetrmarkets, hospitals, restaurants, daycares, department stores, GP, and schools.
2. Collected data was cleaned and normalized.
3. Using Python and R, logworth analysis, clustering, and linear regression were executed to identify correlations between these amenities and livability scores.
   
### 3. Business Recommendation
1. Models with neighborhood features and commercial spaces included are the most accurate,
2. Demographic factors play significant role in determining livability.
3. Analytical dashboard was developed to help Amvest developers investigating and measuring the livability scores related to the number of commercial space and neiborhood features. In this way, this projects successfully cut off time for developers.
