<img src="images/amvest.png?raw=true" alt="Smart Service" width="90%"/>

**Objective**: Given demographic features of an area, the dashboard shows the predicted the number of amenities that will maximize the livability for an area.

**Information shown**:
- Predicted livability score
- Sufficient number of amenities
  
**Applied case**: Urban planning.

**Challenges**: Missing values, data transformation, and inconsistent data.

**Skills**: Excel, Tableau, R, ETL, Exploratory Data Analysis, Hyperparameter Tuning, Git.

## Image Analysis: Face Detection and Classification

**Objective**: Given an image, detect the name of person on the image.

**Method**: 
- Image Pre-Processing: Process 13,233 facial images with *Grayscale model*, representing images in 64x64 pixels in size, then apply PCA to reduce the large set of image files to a smaller set of vectors.
- Facial Information Extraction: Extract the eigenvectors which are related to principal components and represent the eigenfaces.
- Algorithm Development: Build image detection algorithm by using Euclidean distance. The algorithm works by computing the
Euclidean distance between the focal image vector and the eigenface vectors, resulting in 100\% accuracy.

**Skills**: Image Analysis, R, Machine Learning.
